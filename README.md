## Link to project here: "https://rhardin94.github.io/Nerd-Lator/"
### Nerd-lator is a translation-API based project that allows the user to translate english text into 4 other sci-fi/fantasy based languages.
* The user is given a textbox in which to type up the desired english text to be translated on the left side
* The user then presses the "translate" button and the text will disappear from the english box and return translated text in a textbox on the other side of the page.
    * The user may then press the "copy to clipboard" button to be able to paste the translation anywhere they desire off the page.
    * Once the user has finished with the current translation, they may hit the "clear" button to translate another message.
