# Nerd-Lator!
### Deployed Site found here: "https://rhardin94.github.io/Nerd-Lator/"
## Overview
Nerd-lator is a translation-API based project that allows the user to translate english text into other sci-fi/fantasy based languages. Once the user visits the language page of their choice, they may input text they want translated into the left input field. Once satisfied with the message, the user then hits the translate button to receive desired translation. Upon arrival, the user may then copy the translation to the clipboard to share elsewhere!
## How to use

When first viewing the site, the user is directed to the home page.

To begin translating, the user may navigate to the desired language/theme via the button under the related icon

Upon arrival of the desired language page, the user is presented with unique interactions that are different for every fantasy world. If viewing the Klingon page, all of the text is intially rendered in Klingon alphabet until the site translates it back to English.
